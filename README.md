# Hipsteroid

This is a demo app written for the talk [Grails for Hipsters][talk] at [Groovy & Grails Exchange 2012][ggx]. It is a simple _Instagram_-like photo sharing app.

## Structure

`filter` contains a vert.x application that does image processing.
`hipsteroid` contains a Grails application that controls workflow.

## Things you need to run this demo

* [Grails 2.1.2][grails]
* [Vert.x][vert.x]
* [MongoDB][mongo]
* [ImageMagick][im] (you may have this already - try running `convert` in a terminal)

Some way to compileâ€¦

* [CoffeeScript][coffee]
* [LESS][less]
* [Handlebars][hbs]

### Compiling front end resources

I have used [CodeKit][codekit] for CoffeeScript and LESS but you can use whatever you like. For simplicity the compiled `.js` and `.css` files should just go in the same directories as the source files.

To compile on the command line:

	coffee -c web-app/app
	lessc web-app/app/hipsteroid.less > web-app/app/hipsteroid.css
	handlebars web-app/app/templates/ -f web-app/app/templates.js

To install the command line tools:

	npm install -g coffee-script
	gem install less
	npm install -g handlebars

## To run the app

You need to run 3 things simultaneously. I just use 3 terminal tabs.

### The vert.x app

	cd filter
	gradle build
	VERTX_MODS=build/work/mods vertx runmod hipsteroid-filter -cluster

### The grails app

	cd hipsteroid
	grails run-app

### MongoDB

	mongod

## Tests

Unit tests are standard Grails / Spock tests. Javascript tests use [Testem][testem] (`npm install -g testem`), End-to-end tests use [Casper JS][casper] (`brew install casperjs` on a Mac or download from site).

### To run JS unit tests (continuous test mode)

	cd hipsteroid
	testem

Then just point a browser (or multiple browsers) at `http://localhost:7357/`.

### To run JS unit tests (continuous integration mode)

	cd hipsteroid
	testem ci

### To run end-to-end tests

The app must be running before you do this.

	cd hipsteroid
	casperjs test test/end-to-end/
